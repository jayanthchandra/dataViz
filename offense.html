                    <p>The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposition by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing side's a rectangular framed goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is considered as the winner. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Real Madrid had 28 Goals with 21 Assists wheras Bayern Munich Team had a better offensive lineup where they had around 30 goals with 23 assists.</li>
                        <li>When we look deepeer into Goals per minute - Bayern Munich had 3 goals per match compared to Real madrid's 2, this would imply that bayern had lot of strikers or they were grouped in a division with weaker teams</li>
                        <li>Top Scorer for the UEFA was between two teams- Karim Benzema from Real Madrid and Robert Lewandowski from Bayern Munich</li>
                         <li><b>Insight:</b> Real madrid had a balanced offensive team compared to high offensive teams like Man City and Bayern Munich </li>
